      Over the next couple of years there will be a lot of content
        posted on my website for example, Video Projects which you
        can see by clicking on the media work section. Also some
        photography produced and taken by myself. As you can see by
        my current work there is plenty of room for improvement.
        To learn more about me as a person, or need to contact me in
        anyway, all my details are in the about me section at the
        top of the page.
