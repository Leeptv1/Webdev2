        <p>
          For this project We had to design a project using above
          illustrator, this is a software that most top graphic
          designers use. I started by drawing individual rough
          sketches then tried to re-create them in illustrator. As
          you can see in my image I’m still learning how to use the
          software, but it didn’t turn out to bad. Below is my rough
          sketch

        <div id="final">
          <p>
            Down below is my final project were I managed to grab a
            B, really proud of it considering it’s my first attempt
            at illustrator. But eventually I will be a pro and
            people will be viewing this website to offer me a job
            anyway, as you can see in the photo I went for a
            gradient in the background. I also choose the majority
            of images from my sketch. Hope you enjoyed my final
            design
